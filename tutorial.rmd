# Introduction
So you want to be a Data Scientist and don’t know where to start? Well, you’ve come to the right place. 

Today you’ll learn a little about the economy, a whole bunch of data science principles and practice and where to stay on your next trip to New York City!


## Data Science Pipeline
First, let’s look at the data science pipeline. 

The data science pipeline starts with defining what major questions one wants to answer and subsequently **_acquiring and importing the relevant data_** to be analyzed.

Then, the data is viewed and **_data tidying_** must occur; where a rectangular data structure model is assumed and three requirements must be met. Each observation (called an entity) forms a row, each variable (called an attribute) forms a column and each observational unit (type of entity) forms a table.

Leading to the exploratory data analysis process, where the data is transformed and visualized. **_Data cleaning_** may be necessary for missing data. When handling missing data, the missing data may be removed, encoded or imputation (replace missing values with the mean of non-missing values) of a numeric variable may be necessary.

Hypothesis testing and machine learning (ML) modeling are the final steps before the data and its results can be communicated.

## Economy & Vacations
The rise of companies like Airbnb has given rise to The Sharing Economy. The sharing economy is a model defined as the facilitation of goods and services on a peer-to-peer level usually through online community platforms. This new model has made it possible for a great deal of people to gain another source of income and for you to have an affordable vacation.

As more sharing economy companies have opened, like Airbinb and Uber, the way we vacation has changed. This change has been documented and open data on it is available.


## DataSet Used
The data we will be using in this tutorial is [_New York City Airbnb Open Data_](http://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data/data) from Kaggle. We will use this data to look at the relationships between types of housing and location.
